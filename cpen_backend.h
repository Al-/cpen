  \brief API of the proprietary backend library for C-Pen scanner
  \author Andreas Christ <software@quantentunnel.de>
  \date 2017
  \version $(VERSION)
  \copyright This library dynamically links to the Open Source Computer Vision
  library (see http://opencv.org)
  \copyright This library was written using proprietary information from
  Virrata AB, Sweden

  C-Pen is a nice, small hand-held scanner commonly used to scan short lines of
  text, e.g., to copy quotes from a book into a document or from invoice slips
  to online banking. Unluckily there is no Linux support by the manufacturer.
  Reading the USB data is easy, converting the image to text, too. The step in
  between: decoding a proprietary encoded image. This library attempts to do the
  latter, based on proprietary code kindly provided by the manufacturer (thus,
  the library is closed-source).
  \see http://cpen.com

<b>How to use (what *you* need to do)</b>
  - Write an application that reads the data from the USB port\n
    The Linux command 'lsusb -v' provides all required information (endpoint
    number and type, interface id, vendor and product id, ...).
    Recommendation: make use of libusb that allows to write the application in
    user space (i.e., without kernel modules)
  - Forward the read data frames to this library (see cpen_scandata)\n
    This is a non-blocking function. The scanned image is saved to disk and/or
    available by calling cpen_retrieve_output.
  - Convert image to text\n
    Personal recommendation: use tesseract-ocr.

\anchor Error_codes
<b>Error codes</b>

Some functions return a negative value to signal an error or
another non-standard condition. The code is 0 minus the returned value, i.e.,
a code >= 0. 'frame' refers to a single scan obtained from the C-Pen and
forwarded to this library. Error codes may be combined, i.e., more than one
error might have occured.

   Code | Hex      | Mnemonic | Meaning
   ----:|:---------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------
   0    | 0x0000   | E_SUCCESS | No error
   1    | 0x0001   | E_UNSPECIFIED | Unspecified error
   2    | 0x0002   | E_HEADER | Wrong content of header
   4    | 0x0004   | E_FRAMEHEADERSHORT | Wrong length of header (too short)
   8    | 0x0008   | E_OUTOFMEMORY | Out of memory
   16   | 0x0010   | E_NOIMAGE | No image (no call of end-of-scan frame submitted?)
   32   | 0x0020   | E_OUTOFIMAGEID | Too many images (more than max integer or than files per directory)
   64   | 0x0040   | E_NOOUTPUT | No output available
   128  | 0x0080   | E_PATHTOOLONG | File path ot output file too long
   256  | 0x0100   | E_NOMATCH | Could not stitch the individual scans together
   512  | 0x0200   | E_PIXELFRAMESHORT | Too few pixels in frame
   1024 | 0x0400   | E_PIXELHEADERSHORT | Too short image-specific subheader of frame
   2048 | 0x0800   | E_IMWRITE | Write-error of OpenCV library
   4096 | 0x1000   | E_IMENCODE | Image encoding error of OpenCV library
   8192 | 0x2000   | E_FILEERROR | Error when writing file
   16384| 0x4000   | E_NOBITMAP | Could not convert submitted pixels to bitmap

   Values > 0xFFFF are not an error but return the button status of the C-Pen
   (in the two least significant bits)

\attention these codes may change in minor versions of the library

  If the binary (compiled) library going with this header file is not available
  for your favorite processor architecture (on linux), feel free to drop me a
  mail. The library requires that OpenCV is installed (i.e., libopencv-core,
  libopencv-imgproc, libopencv-video, libopencv-stitching)

  In principle, USB frames of button status need not be submitted to the ibrary with this function,
  but it also not hurts. The return value will then be a negative number with the button status
  coded in the least significant bits (2 bits for the 2 buttons of the C-Pen 3.0)
